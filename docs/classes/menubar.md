## Available Methods

See [BaseMenu](baseMenu.md#available-methods) for a list of inherited methods.

### Initialize
The initialize function will run [BaseMenu's initialize](baseMenu.md#initialize), as well as sets up the [focus](baseMenu.md#handleFocus), [click](baseMenu.md#handleClick), [hover](baseMenu.md#handleHover), [keydown](#handleKeydown), and [keyup](#handleKeyup) events through the menu.

This will also set the role of the menu element to "menubar", and ensure the first menu item is in the tab index.

### handleKeydown
Handles keydown events throughout the menu for proper menu use.

This method exists to assit the [handleKeyup](#handleKeyup) method.

- Adds all `keydown` listeners listed in [BaseMenu](baseMenu.md#handleKeydown).
- Adds a `keydown` listener to the menu/all submenus.
  - Blocks propagation on the following keys: "ArrowUp", "ArrowRight", "ArrowDown", "ArrowLeft", "Home", "End", "Space", "Enter", "Escape", and "A" through "Z".
  - Completely closes the menu and moves focus out if the "Tab" key is pressed.

### handleKeyup
Handles keyup events throughout the menu for proper menu use.

Adds all `keyup` listeners listed in [BaseMenu](baseMenu.md#handleKeyup).
