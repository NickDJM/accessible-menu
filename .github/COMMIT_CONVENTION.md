# Git Commit Convention

This project uses the conventional commit standard, which means your commits should follow a basic template of:

> \<type>[optional scope]: \<description>
>
> [optional body]
>
> [optional footer(s)]

For more detailed information about available types, scopes, breaking changes, etc. please see the [official documentation](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

This project also provides a command to assist you in formatting commit messages using [commitizen](https://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/):

```shell
npm run commit
```
